            The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited
            to all communal living spaces and bedrooms. Consisting of a series
            of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s
            appearance changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full
            depending on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional storage
            for your reading material and an even top for decorative
            accessories.

            Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and
            construction, as well as the visual lightness, form the aesthetic
            characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel,
            a girder and shelves, the system functions similar to a construction
            kit. Only four screws fix the girder together to which the shelves
            are simply hung up without any tools. The material and precision of
            the components guarantee the stability and assembly.

          <p class="text">
            Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to
            diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side table,
            bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine collection,
            serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding small personal
            essentials as a hallway tray. The Float Shelf equally adds a touch
            of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation and
            boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the
            strict geometry of this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a
            sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels cut
            from a single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition
            allowing for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the
            reduced aesthetic principles of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition,
            its design distils the essence of a shelf.
